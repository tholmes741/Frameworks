# Rails-Lite

MVC framework written in Ruby, inspired by the main functionality of Rails.

The purpose of this Rails Lite project is to demonstrate an understanding of the Ruby on Rails framework and MVC frameworks in general.

## Features

Rails Lite includes a custom router and controller base.

### Router

The router uses metaprogramming to dynamically create routes for each controller action. It runs routes to call controller actions corresponding to passed requests.

### Controller Base

The Controller Base roughly corresponds to Rails' ActionController::Base, providing standard methods to user-defined controllers. Methods include #render, #redirect_to, and #session.

### Session

Gives the ability to get and set cookies.
